### Data Analytics JourneyðŸ‘¾

Welcome to my Data Analytics journey! This repository marks the beginning of an exciting adventure where I dive deep into the world of data analysis.

# Introduction
In this first project, I have focused on utilizing fundamentals of statistics and various Excel features, such as Lookups, conditional formatting, and pivot tables. It serves as a foundation to build upon.

# Future Projects
Moving forward, I am enthusiastic to delve into other areas of Data Analytics, including VBA scripting, Python programming (using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib), API interactions, databases (such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB), ETL (Extract-Transform-Load), front-end web visualization (using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript Charting), Geomapping with Leaflet.js, Business Intelligence software (such as Tableau and PowerBI), and advanced topics like Big Data Analytics with Hadoop and Machine Learning.

# Thank You
